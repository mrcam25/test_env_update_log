# test_env_update_log

## Apprenticeship coursework

This project was a front-end task for my apprenticeship course. This was one of the earliest tasks I was given from the course.

The assignment brief was to design, build and deploy a working responsive web application. I chose to build a log for my workplace's test environments. This log was designed to replace the Excel Spreadsheet which was being used to hold database changes, dates, times, etc.

Attached are the .html, .css and .js files for the Test Environment Update Log web app. 

Current release does NOT save to storage (local, session or otherwise) for security reasons.

The lastest release was hosted on a free .ASP server - http://www.testdblog.somee.com/log_page/logPage.asp
